# Simple Avatars!

1. Drag and drop avatar into your file
2. Override the random default name, if you want
3. Select a gender
4. ...
5. Profit!

I actually don't know if this will work as it relies on some external libs. You may have to `cd` into the project dir and `yarn install` /shrug

Uses avatars from https://uifaces.co/. Thanks!
