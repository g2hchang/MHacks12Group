# Simulate a browser

This component let's you render your designs in a Safari browser to simulate a desktop environment. You can change the background, add a wallpaper from Unsplash, and toggle the Safari toolbar on and off.

Give it a try and let me know what you think on Twitter --> [@zach__johnston](https://twitter.com/zach__johnston)

## Usage

Simple! Just plop the component in and drag a line to the page you want to render.
